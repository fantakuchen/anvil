## About Anvil

This boilerplate serves as the foundational setup for a robust and modular game development system constructed atop Excalibur.js. Designed specifically for a MonoRepo environment, our structure aims to streamline collaboration and enhance scalability across multiple TypeScript projects.

This initial setup is intended to provide developers with a well-organized framework, encouraging exploration and expansion within the game development ecosystem. As you integrate additional features and build out your game mechanics, this platform will support your creative and technical requirements through its adaptable and maintainable architecture.
